    "### Answer:  The optimal policies obtained by Policy Iteration and Value Iteration are slightly different for the above stochastic environment, as convergence rates, exploration rates of state-action space, algorithms, and update rules are different. Value iteration updates the value function iteratively until it converges whereas policy iteration iterates between policy evaluation and policy improvement steps. PI converges faster than VI due to its iteration between policy evaluation and improvement, while VI requires some iterations to converge. As number of iterations are not being specified in policy iteration, it takes more time to run, while value iteration does a single iteration of policy evaluation at each step. "
